# Exercise1


Familiarize yourself with the assembly language materials available on the 6.828 [reference page](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html). You don't have to read them now, but you'll almost certainly want to refer to some of this material when reading and writing x86 assembly.

We do recommend reading the section "The Syntax" in [Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html). It gives a good (and quite brief) description of the AT&T assembly syntax we'll be using with the GNU assembler in JOS.
